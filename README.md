# CPE_matchstick_2017
First year mini project based on a very famous game based on matchsticks. It is composed of a certain number of matchstick lines. The players plays against the AI; the player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks. If done, it's the AI turn to play. The loser is the one to take the last matchstick.
